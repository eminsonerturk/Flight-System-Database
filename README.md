Flight System Database Design and Implementation

  A flight system database was designed for any airport and specific operations were performed on the relevant data.
  
  If you want to see the architecture and design of the system, you can review the FlightSystemArchitecture.jpg file.
  
  After the tables were created in mssql environment with the codes in the FlightSystemTabloKodları.sql file, sample data 
  was added from the ProjeOrnekVerilerim.sql file. After this, sql operations have been performed for this added data in 
  the Proje_PART1.sql file.
